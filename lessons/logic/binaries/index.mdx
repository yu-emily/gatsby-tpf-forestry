## Binary numbers
In the digital world, binaries are represented by 1 and 0. These digits interact with the hardware system to perform logic or any operations. The combination of these digits represents the numbers from **0 to 9**.

The combination of 1 and 0 represents the entire set of numbers and characters. These numbers interact with computers using the binary language unknown to humans. Simple machines or transistors have two options **on** or **off**. But while you are interacting with a computer with documents and images or videos the binary files created using the binary numbers are huge.
