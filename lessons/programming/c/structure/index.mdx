# Structure

### The structure of C programs consists of the header files, source files, main function, and comments. Along with these, you have functions, variables, statements, and expressions.

## Compile
C compiles instructions. This means - C takes instructions from the programmer and converts them to machine readable language to help the computer understand and follow the instructions. Therefore, to run a C program, it needs to be compiled first.

## Data type
The data types are declared as variables or functions of different types. They have a specific associated memory and specific operations that are performed. These are the common data types:

- **int** - The value ranges from **âˆ’32,767 to +32,767**
- **char** - Any letter from **A to Z** or **a to z**
- **float** - single precision floating point number
- **double** - double precision floating point number

## Header file
Header files are files with **.h** extension. These contain the declaration of functions that are used in the program. For example, including the `<stdio.h>` allows you to use the **printf()** function. The header files define data types, function prototypes, and C pre-processor directives. You can also have custom header files with **.h** extensions to define the functions that can be directly used in the application.

## Source file
The file that includes the code and uses the header files is a source file. By including the header file, the source file directs the C compiler to process the header file before compilation. The source file also includes the data type, variables, functions and all the code required for functional application.

## Main function
The **main()** function starts the execution of the program and the entry point of the program. Once you compile and run the program, the execution control enters the **main()**.

- The void defines the return type of a function. It is nothing and states that the **main()** does not return any value after executing your code.
- C executes the **main()** function first.

```c
int main() {
  ...
  ...
  return 0;
}
```

## Return statement
A return statement stops execution of the function and gives back control to the calling function. In the above example, the calling function is `main()`.

This returns an integer:
```c
return 0;
```

## Comment
Comments in C language allow you to describe the code or the logic written for the program. You can have single or multiple lines of comments.

A single line comment can be declared using `//`
```c
// This is a comment
```

A multi line comment can be declared using `/* */`
```c
/*
First line
Second line
third line
...
...
...
*/
```

## Compiling a C program
We need compilers to compile a C program. Famous C compilers include, **gcc** and **clang**.

In a Unix system, to compile a **.c** file:
```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ gcc your_program.c
```

Once compiled, you can see the binary file by typing ls:
```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Pictures  Music  Public  Videos  a.out
```

By default the compiled binary file is called, **a.out**.
To run the binary file:
```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ ./a.out
Hello Earth
```
