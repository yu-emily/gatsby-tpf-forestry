# Structure

## Comment
Comments allow you to describe the code or the logic written for the program. You can have single or multiple lines of comments. To comment in Python, use **#**:

```python
# This is a comment
```
A multi line comment can be declared using **“““ “““**
```python
"""
First line
Second line
third line
...
...
...
"""
```

## Python shell
Similar to Unix shell, Python has a shell prompt **>>>**. The prompt takes input and shows the output in the next line.

```python
>>>
```

Here's an example of adding variables using the prompt:
```python
>>> x = 4 + 1
>>> y = 2 + 1
>>> z = x + y
>>> z
8
```

## File extension
The extension of a python script file is **.py**
![Source Files](./images/source.png)

Here's the same addition program inside a python script file:
```python
x = 4 + 1
y = 2 + 1
z = x + y

print(z)
```

To run this python script in a Unix shell:
```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ python addition.py
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ 8
```
