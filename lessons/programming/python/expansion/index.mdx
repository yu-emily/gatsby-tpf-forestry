# Expansion

## If Else statements
```python
If it's raining
    take the umbrella
else
    no need to take the umbrella
```

Let’s write this program using If Else statements:
```python
rain = 1

if (rain == 1):
    print("Take the umbrella\n")
else:
    print("No need to take the umbrella\n")
```

**Output:**
```python
Take the umbrella
```

## Loop
Loops in python help to execute a given code repeatedly. The loop iterates the block sequentially until the condition is true. The code specified under the loop is indented for grouping.

### for loop
This loop executes a sequence of statements for all the given items in the list or array. The "for loop" break from the loop once the iteration of the values in the list is over.

```python
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(i)
```

**Output:**
```python
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

### While loop
This loop executes the code until the given condition for the execution is true. Here the syntax differs from the C but the logic remains the same.

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
```

**Output:**
```python
0
1
2
3
4
```

### Nested loop
Nested loops are loops inside other loops. However, it’s very inefficient in some cases.

```python
for i in range(1, 3):
  for j in range(3, 6):
    print(i, j)
```

**Output:**
```python
1 3
1 4
1 5
2 3
2 4
2 5
```

## Breaking the loop
- **Break statement** - The loop is terminated by using a break; This caused the pointer to move out of the loop and executes the next statement following the loop code.
- **Continue statement** -  It causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition before reiterating.
- **Goto statement** - Transfers control to the labeled statement.

<Note>To avoid infinite looping, ensure that the conditions given for the loop are validated at some point. This will stop the loop once the condition is false.</Note>

## File Input/Output
File input and output allows a program to interact with the user. The output function like **print()** prints the statement or values in console, and **input()** reads the values from the console. There are functions to read values, file objects, etc for the program.

## Function
Functions are known as building blocks of programs. A large problem can be divided into smaller functions, this makes the code readable.

- The reuse of the code is easy.
- Each function take only one responsibility and is interdependent
- Functions are logical, modular and readable to human eyes. Thus makes it easier to maintain the programs further.

To define a function:
```python
# Defining a function
def honk():
    print("Car honks")
```

To call this function:
```python
# Defining a function
def honk():
    print("Car honks")

# Calling the function
honk()
```

**Output:**
```
Car honks
```
