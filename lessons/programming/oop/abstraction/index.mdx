# Abstraction

### Abstraction concept comes with a real-time scenario, where only necessary details are revealed
A real-life example of a man driving car displays the abstraction of the mechanism implemented in the car. The driver is exposed to the ABC parts of the car i.e accelerator, brake and clutch. He is just aware of using these tools to move the car but is unaware of how the car moves when an accelerator is pressed. This is called abstraction.

In OOP, the abstraction allows the classes to expose only limited functions via the interface of abstract methods. The clients that use these interfaces are not aware of other internal functions that help in processing their request or call. This also allows the hiding of information from the outside world.
