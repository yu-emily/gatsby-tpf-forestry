# Algorithm

### An algorithm is the set of instructions in steps to solve a problem.

In real-life if you had to count the number of members in a room, you would count one by one until you finish counting the last member.

So we count a member and add a next to the previous counted number and repeat the same procedure until there are no members in the room. This is a step-wise procedure and that a normal person follows to count the members.

For a computer to do the exact steps like humans, we create an algorithm containing the steps to execute. In this case, pseudo-code of an algorithm to count the members will be like.

## Flowchart
An algorithm can be described as a pictorial representation with different symbols, shapes, arrow that describes the different process. Each shape describes a different process:

- The process is represented graphically.
- The process is described block by block.
- The described steps are easy to follow.
- Cost less time and does not require the understanding of code.
