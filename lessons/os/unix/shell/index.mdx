# Unix Shell

### The shell is the interactive command line interface for Unix based operating systems. The user can type commands to accomplish certain tasks.

## Printing a message
To display a **Hello Earth** message in a Unix shell, type:

```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ echo "Hello Earth"
```

<Note>Quotations are not necessary. However, if the message contains special characters, it will show errors. Therefore, using quotations is nice practice.</Note>

## Clearing the screen
To clear the screen, type:

```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ clear
```

## Listing files and directories
To list all the directories and files, type:

```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ ls
```

<Note>An alternative to <b>ls</b> is <b>l</b>. This works because <b>l</b> is an alias of <b>ls</b>.</Note>

## Navigating through directories
To go inside a directory, type:

```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ cd Pictures
```

The shell prompt shows a **/** in the beginning of the current directory:
```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~/Pictures$
```

To list contents of a directory without going inside the directory, type:
```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ ls Pictures
```

## Creating directories and files
To create a new directory in the Unix file system, type:

```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ mkdir new_directory
```

Multiple directories can be created using:
```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ mkdir new_directory1 new_directory2
```

<Note>The shell shows an error if a directory with the same name already exists.</Note>

To create a file in an Unix file system, type:
```
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ touch file.txt
```

Multiple files with different extensions can be created using:
```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ touch program.c program.h
```

<Note>Unix replaces the existing file with the new file, if they have the same name.</Note>

## Adding and editing contents of a file
Adding text in text file can be done using different programs such as, **GNU nano**, **Vim** or **Emacs**.

To create a file using the text editor **Vim** and add text, type:
```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ vim file.txt
```

Add some texts, press **[Esc]**, then type **:wq** to save.
<Note>In Vim <b>w</b> stands for write and <b>q</b> stands for quit.</Note>

## Reading files
To read a text file, type:

```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ cat file.txt
```

## Removing files and directories
To remove a file from the Unix file system, type:

```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ rm file.txt
```

Directories can be removed using the flag, -r:
```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ rm -r new_directory
```
