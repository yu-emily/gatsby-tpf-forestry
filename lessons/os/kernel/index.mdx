# Kernel

### The kernel is the core component of an operating system. It takes complete control over the system by bridging the gap between the users and hardware.

## Main tasks of the kernel
- Memory Management
- Device Management
- Performance Management
- Resource Management
- System Management

There are different types of Kernels:

### Monolithic kernel
These are the basic types where the Kernel and OS share the same memory space. The security concern for these machines is less. Usually faster than other devices as space is the same.

<Note><b>Linux</b> is not an operating system. <b>Linux</b> is Monolithic kernel.</Note>

### Microkernel
Microkernels have the minimum components required to build an operating system.

### Hybrid kernel
These are a mix of Microkernel and Monolithic kernel.

<Note><b>Windows</b> and <b>macOS</b> have Hybrid kernels.</Note>
